I have included four images, two large originals, and there zoomed-out versions. Test you algorithm by computing the sum of squared difference (SSD) when you scale-up the given small images by a factor of 4 by comparing with the original images.

Upload a six-page report named as your_index_a01.pdf. The report must include important parts of code, image results, and comparison of results . The interpretation of results and the discussion are important in the report. Extra-page penalty is 2 marks per page.
